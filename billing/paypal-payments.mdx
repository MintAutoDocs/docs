### PayPal Subscriptions

A PayPal Subscription is an automated payment arrangement created to make periodic payments of a specific amount at predefined intervals. If you opted for a subscription during your service activation, your account will automatically initiate payments according to the service interval you selected (Monthly, Quarterly, Semi-Annually, or Annually). This feature guarantees uninterrupted service, eliminating the need for manual invoice payments.

### Cancelling Billing Agreements

1. Log in to your PayPal account.
2. Click Profile (the gear icon) on the top right corner of the page.
3. Click Pre-approved payments under "Payment settings".
4. Select the merchant whose agreement you want to cancel, and click Cancel.
5. Follow the provided instructions to complete the cancellation of the agreement.

<Warning>

If you donâ€™t have access to your PayPal account, you should contact us directly to cancel the agreement.
