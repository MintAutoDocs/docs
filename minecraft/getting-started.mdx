## Basic Administration

In Vanilla Minecraft, there are a set of fundamental administrative commands available for managing player access to your server. These commands can serve as warning systems or enable you to remove problematic players from your community. To execute these commands, you will need to provide the username of the player in the designated space. The first command, "`/kick`", allows you to kick a player out of the server. This will immediately remove them from the game. The second command, "`/ban`", enables you to ban a player from the server. Once banned, they will be unable to join unless you choose to un-ban them. To un-ban a player, you can use the command "`/pardon`".

Additionally, you have the option to ban a player's IP address. This means that even if the player attempts to access the server using a different account on the same network, they will still be unable to join. To accomplish this, you can utilize the command "`/ban-ip`". Should you wish to reverse the ban on a player's IP, you can use the command "`/pardon-ip`".
